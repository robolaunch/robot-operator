                      type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage
                      when embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes many
                      fields which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion
                      and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage. 2.
                      Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for
                      individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular
                      restrictions like, \"must refer only to types A and B\" or \"UID
                      not honored\" or \"name must be restricted\". Those cannot be
                      well described when embedded. 3. Inconsistent validation.  Because
                      the usages are different, the validation rules are different
                      by usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will
                      happen. 4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.
                      \ Kind is not a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity
                      during interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most cases,
                      the dependency is on the group,resource tuple and the version
                      of the actual struct is irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change
                      it.  Because this type is embedded in many locations, updates
                      to this type will affect numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs
                      embed an underspecified API type they do not control. \n Instead
                      of using this type, create a locally provided and used type
                      that is well-focused on your reference. For example, ServiceReferences
                      for admission registration: https://github.com/kubernetes/api/blob/release-1.17/admissionregistration/v1/types.go#L533

                      type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage
                      when embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes many
                      fields which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion
                      and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage. 2.
                      Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for
                      individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular
                      restrictions like, \"must refer only to types A and B\" or \"UID
                      not honored\" or \"name must be restricted\". Those cannot be
                      well described when embedded. 3. Inconsistent validation.  Because
                      the usages are different, the validation rules are different
                      by usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will
                      happen. 4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.
                      \ Kind is not a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity
                      during interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most cases,
                      the dependency is on the group,resource tuple and the version
                      of the actual struct is irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change

                              New uses of this type are discouraged because of difficulty
                              describing its usage when embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored
                              fields.  It includes many fields which are not generally
                              honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath
                              are both very rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid
                              usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for
                              individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are
                              particular restrictions like, \"must refer only to types
                              A and B\" or \"UID not honored\" or \"name must be restricted\".
                              Those cannot be well described when embedded. 3. Inconsistent
                              validation.  Because the usages are different, the validation
                              rules are different by usage, which makes it hard for
                              users to predict what will happen. 4. The fields are
                              both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise
                              mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during
                              interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most
                              cases, the dependency is on the group,resource tuple
                              and the version of the actual struct is irrelevant.
                              5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is
                              embedded in many locations, updates to this type will

                        of this type are discouraged because of difficulty describing
                        its usage when embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes
                        many fields which are not generally honored.  For instance,
                        ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in
                        actual usage. 2. Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to
                        add specific help for individual usage.  In most embedded
                        usages, there are particular restrictions like, \"must refer
                        only to types A and B\" or \"UID not honored\" or \"name must
                        be restricted\". Those cannot be well described when embedded.
                        3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages are different,
                        the validation rules are different by usage, which makes it
                        hard for users to predict what will happen. 4. The fields
                        are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise
                        mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation
                        and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency
                        is on the group,resource tuple and the version of the actual
                        struct is irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change it.  Because
                        this type is embedded in many locations, updates to this type
                        will affect numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs embed an
                        underspecified API type they do not control. \n Instead of
                        using this type, create a locally provided and used type that
                        is well-focused on your reference. For example, ServiceReferences

                                        are discouraged because of difficulty describing
                                        its usage when embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored
                                        fields.  It includes many fields which are
                                        not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion
                                        and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in
                                        actual usage. 2. Invalid usage help.  It is
                                        impossible to add specific help for individual
                                        usage.  In most embedded usages, there are
                                        particular restrictions like, \"must refer
                                        only to types A and B\" or \"UID not honored\"
                                        or \"name must be restricted\". Those cannot
                                        be well described when embedded. 3. Inconsistent
                                        validation.  Because the usages are different,
                                        the validation rules are different by usage,
                                        which makes it hard for users to predict what
                                        will happen. 4. The fields are both imprecise
                                        and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise
                                        mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity
                                        during interpretation and require a REST mapping.
                                        \ In most cases, the dependency is on the
                                        group,resource tuple and the version of the
                                        actual struct is irrelevant. 5. We cannot
                                        easily change it.  Because this type is embedded
                                        in many locations, updates to this type will
                                        affect numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs
                                        embed an underspecified API type they do not
                                        control. \n Instead of using this type, create
                                        a locally provided and used type that is well-focused
                                        on your reference. For example, ServiceReferences

                          uses of this type are discouraged because of difficulty
                          describing its usage when embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.
                          \ It includes many fields which are not generally honored.
                          \ For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very
                          rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid usage help.  It
                          is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.
                          \ In most embedded usages, there are particular restrictions
                          like, \"must refer only to types A and B\" or \"UID not
                          honored\" or \"name must be restricted\". Those cannot be
                          well described when embedded. 3. Inconsistent validation.
                          \ Because the usages are different, the validation rules
                          are different by usage, which makes it hard for users to
                          predict what will happen. 4. The fields are both imprecise
                          and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping to a
                          URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation and
                          require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is
                          on the group,resource tuple and the version of the actual
                          struct is irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change it.  Because
                          this type is embedded in many locations, updates to this
                          type will affect numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs

                                  --- New uses of this type are discouraged because
                                  of difficulty describing its usage when embedded
                                  in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields
                                  which are not generally honored.  For instance,
                                  ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very rarely
                                  valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid usage help.  It
                                  is impossible to add specific help for individual
                                  usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular
                                  restrictions like, \"must refer only to types A
                                  and B\" or \"UID not honored\" or \"name must be
                                  restricted\". Those cannot be well described when
                                  embedded. 3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the
                                  usages are different, the validation rules are different
                                  by usage, which makes it hard for users to predict
                                  what will happen. 4. The fields are both imprecise
                                  and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping
                                  to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation
                                  and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the
                                  dependency is on the group,resource tuple and the
                                  version of the actual struct is irrelevant. 5. We
                                  cannot easily change it.  Because this type is embedded
                                  in many locations, updates to this type will affect
                                  numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs embed an
                                  underspecified API type they do not control. \n
                                  Instead of using this type, create a locally provided
                                  and used type that is well-focused on your reference.

                                      value like: "spec.containers{name}" (where "name"
                                      refers to the name of the container that triggered

                              individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are
                              particular restrictions like, \"must refer only to types
                              A and B\" or \"UID not honored\" or \"name must be restricted\".
                              Those cannot be well described when embedded. 3. Inconsistent
                              validation.  Because the usages are different, the validation
                              rules are different by usage, which makes it hard for
                              users to predict what will happen. 4. The fields are
                              both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise
                              mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during
                              interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most
                              cases, the dependency is on the group,resource tuple
                              and the version of the actual struct is irrelevant.
                              5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is
                              embedded in many locations, updates to this type will
                              affect numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs embed
                              an underspecified API type they do not control. \n Instead
                              of using this type, create a locally provided and used
                              type that is well-focused on your reference. For example,

                      when embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes many
                      fields which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion

                      well described when embedded. 3. Inconsistent validation.  Because
                      the usages are different, the validation rules are different
                      by usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will

                              New uses of this type are discouraged because of difficulty
                              describing its usage when embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored
                              fields.  It includes many fields which are not generally
                              honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath
                              are both very rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid
                              usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for
                              individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are
                              particular restrictions like, \"must refer only to types
                              A and B\" or \"UID not honored\" or \"name must be restricted\".
                              Those cannot be well described when embedded. 3. Inconsistent
                              validation.  Because the usages are different, the validation
                              rules are different by usage, which makes it hard for
                              users to predict what will happen. 4. The fields are
                              both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise
                              mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during
                              interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most
                              cases, the dependency is on the group,resource tuple

                              New uses of this type are discouraged because of difficulty
                              describing its usage when embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored
                              fields.  It includes many fields which are not generally
                              honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath
                              are both very rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid
                              usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for
                              individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are
                              particular restrictions like, \"must refer only to types
                              A and B\" or \"UID not honored\" or \"name must be restricted\".
                              Those cannot be well described when embedded. 3. Inconsistent
                              validation.  Because the usages are different, the validation
                              rules are different by usage, which makes it hard for
                              users to predict what will happen. 4. The fields are
                              both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise
                              mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during
                              interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most
                              cases, the dependency is on the group,resource tuple
                              and the version of the actual struct is irrelevant.
                              5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is
                              embedded in many locations, updates to this type will
                              affect numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs embed
                              an underspecified API type they do not control. \n Instead
                              of using this type, create a locally provided and used
                              type that is well-focused on your reference. For example,

                              New uses of this type are discouraged because of difficulty
                              describing its usage when embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored
                              fields.  It includes many fields which are not generally
                              honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath
                              are both very rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid
                              usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for
                              individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are
                              particular restrictions like, \"must refer only to types
                              A and B\" or \"UID not honored\" or \"name must be restricted\".
                              Those cannot be well described when embedded. 3. Inconsistent
                              validation.  Because the usages are different, the validation
                              rules are different by usage, which makes it hard for
                              users to predict what will happen. 4. The fields are
                              both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise
                              mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during
                              interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most
                              cases, the dependency is on the group,resource tuple
                              and the version of the actual struct is irrelevant.
                              5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is
                              embedded in many locations, updates to this type will
                              affect numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs embed
                              an underspecified API type they do not control. \n Instead
                              of using this type, create a locally provided and used
                              type that is well-focused on your reference. For example,

                                  instead of an entire object, this string should
                                  contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement,
                                  such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2]. For
                                  example, if the object reference is to a container
                                  within a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}"
                                  (where "name" refers to the name of the container
                                  that triggered the event) or if no container name
                                  is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
                                  index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only
                                  to have some well-defined way of referencing a part
                                  of an object. TODO: this design is not final and
                                  this field is subject to change in the future.'
